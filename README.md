API Implementation using The One API (https://the-one-api.dev/)

Issue #1 - API Access when using a key




tried different methods, had some issues with the headers but fixed it. Also realized that the access key had to include the word 'Bearer' before the given key to work properly.




Issue #2 - Implementing a user-menu




I tried coding it like I do in C#, with a while-loop displaying options and and a switch statement carrying out the relevant code depending on user input.
I found out switch statements don't quite work in python, and when I looked around further I found the match method. Tried to implement it but when I read some more, I found that there's a menu method in python, which is what I ended up choosing to implement.
